# Neon Light Flow: Interstellar Survival
Hyper-fast, neon-styled survival shooter (v7.1 Stable) built with plain HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Steer a glowing ship, stack combos, grab artifacts, and survive escalating enemy phases and boss assaults.

## How to Play
- Move: steer with your mouse cursor or a single touch; the ship follows your pointer.
- Dash: press `Shift` (or tap the dash button) for a short burst.
- EMP: press `Space` (or tap the EMP button) to clear nearby threats on a cooldown.
- Level-ups: pick one of three upgrade cards; artifacts render as icons on the HUD.
- Goals: keep your combo alive, gather XP orbs, survive successive phases, and defeat bosses.

## Run Locally
1) Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser, or  
2) Serve the folder and browse to it (e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`).

## Stack
- Vanilla JS + HTML5 Canvas (no external deps)
